# F.R.I.D.A.Y.
**Female Replacement Intelligent Digital Assistant Youth**--Friday--
 the virtual assistant made by python  

## Overview
This is a virtual assistant made by python named **Friday** (motivated by iron man movies)
this can talk like Friday but not at the level as we imagine.                                            

This can do several works through **voice commands** given by us.

We will stay in the consumer place and check everything in our project and makes everyone 
happy with our work
## Working
It will talk to you and wishes you concerning the time,
When you command as **tell me a joke** and can send emails and writes mail content what you speak it converts speech to text, this function works when you say **send mail**. It can take screenshot shutdown, restart, and log out through voice commands. It will also tell time with the command **tell time**. Tells the **CPU** working frequency and can search Wikipedia and opens some top websites to search meanings of words this project will be extended concerning time for me and my team.we introduced a GUI interface for our assistant.

## Updates
All new update for **Jarvis** to **Friday**
Male voice from Jarvis changed to Female voice in Friday.
For better female voice, we moved to gtts module from pyttsx3 module.
We added new commands like reading pdf,opening camer and many more.
Instead of playing only one song while Friday intro and satrtup we addded few more mp3 files and we added all of them in a random function, so that it plays randomly instead of playing only one mp3 file.
